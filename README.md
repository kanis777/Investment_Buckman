## Problem Statement ðŸŽ¯
You are provided with a dataset containing information about individuals and their investment behavior. Your task is to build a recommendation system that can predict the best investment decision for new data based on various factors available in the dataset.

## Features âš™

1. *Data Collection:* 
   - Retrieves data from the mysql server and fetches all the data from the data table.The given data file is in the format of excel which is converted into csv and and imported through data wizard to sql server.
   - The sql connector is then used to connect the data with vscode to extract the data to perform further actions.

2. *Data Preprocessing and Exploration:*
   - Performs cleaning by handling missing values, null values and duplicates.
   - Outlier detection is done by Z-score ,boxplot and IQR.
   - Utilizes machine learning models and visualizations for exploration of data.
   - Exploration of data is done 
   - Missing values is dealt using using forward pass for numerical columns and by replacing with mode for categorical columns
   - Label encoding is done to change the data into a more usable format

     ### boxplot for outlier detection

3.*Feature Selection*:
    Correlation matrix of heatmap is utilized and plotted visually 

     ### Heatmap

4. *Model Building and Evaluation:*
   - Implements decision tree, random forest and nn models.
   - Decision tree has overfitting problem and is dealt with by ridge regularization.
   - Random forest does hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy levels
   - Evaluates model performance using confusion matrix,accuracy scores,f1-score,precision and recall and helps in finding inconsistency or consistency in the data.
   - Feature importance is done for the best model in each category -decision tree, random forest and neural network

5. *Visualization and Insights:*
   - Generates interactive tables using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Streamlit.
   - Displays various exploration of demographic distribution,employee details and investment details.
   - Plotted line chart,heatmap, pie chart and bar chart .
   - Provides actionable insights and statistical summaries to aid decision-making.
   - Images in the Gallery section are resized for better viewing.
  
   *The best model is saved in pickle file(here random forest is the best model) and a user friendly environment is provided for user entry of data and prediction in streamlit*
